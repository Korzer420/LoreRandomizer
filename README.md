# LoreRandomizer
Hollow Knight Randomizer 4 connection that adds a bunch of lore related checks.

## Settings

### Use Custom Lore

If lore tablets are not randomized, this will place the "enhanced" lore items at their vanilla locations instead.

### Randomize NPC
Randomizes certain NPC and their respective dialogue. (21 locations + 21 items)
The focus is on NPC which mostly exists for lore purposes. After you obtained their check and reload the room, the behave normally.
This includes:
- Bardoon
- Bretta* (in Fungal Wastes)
- Brumm (in the Grimm Tent)
- Dung Defender (after the fight in his arena)

Npc marked with "*" have special properties:
- Bretta: Her house unlocks after obtaining her DIALOGUE ITEM, not talking to her in Fungal Wastes.
- Godseeker: Requires a room reload after freeing her to be able to obtain the item.
- Millibelle: Will not talk to you if you have Grimmchild equip (Vanilla behaviour?)
- Sly: His shop unlocks after obtaining his DIALOGUE ITEM, not talking to him in Crossroads.

**Ghost NPC are killable even if their check hasn't been obtained yet. Reloading the room will spawn a shiny in their place then.**

### Randomize Dream Nail Dialogue
Randomizes "major" dream nail dialogues with their locations (19 locations + 19 items)
This includes:

Locations with a "*" have special properties:

- Grimm Summoner Corpse: The nightmare lantern cannot be activated by normal means. Obtaining the Grimm summoner dream nail check, automatically unlocks Grimm (Grimmchild still works)
- Shade Golem: Has two checks, depending on if you have Void Heart or not. If you have Void Heart but not obtained the first one yet, the first one takes priority. It requires a room reload to obtain the second item then.

### Randomize Point of Interest

### Randomize Travellers
Randomizes Quirrel, Zote, Tiso, Cloth and Hornet encounters. (34 locations + 34 items)
If you choose "Vanilla" as the travel order, the npc will only appear once you collected enough of their dialogue checks (which exactly it is, doesn't matter)
This does include special encounters:
- Hornet will not appear in Kingdom's Edge.
- Zote will not appear in the colosseum.
- Quirrel will not appear in the Uumuu fight.
- Hornet will not appear in the THK fight, increasing true ending requirements by the Hornet stages.

**The order follows the one on their respective Hollow Knight wiki page.**
The progress on these levels can be seen in the inventory on the tracker (the focus icon)

### Randomize Elderbug Rewards
Adds a egg shop like location to Elderbug, which requires lore items to get the items.
A tablet is added next to Elderbug to preview the items he has.
As "lore items" count every item from the pools above and the normal lore tablets/custom lore.
The progress of lore amount can be seen in the inventory on the tracker (the focus icon)
**You can only activate this if at least one pool of the above is randomized!**

### Randomize Shrine of Believers
Adds up to 28 lore tablets in the Shrine of Believers which can be destroyed to obtain their item once their condition is met.
These are bingo like goals that the player must solve. The reward is displayed when reading.
Activating this will likely scarce shops.
**Does NOT add items by itself!**
The shrine goals currently can be:
- Obtain Herrah
- Obtain Lurien
- Obtain Monomon
- Kill Myla :(
- SLUG IN TUB (Focus in a hotspring while you have Shape of Unn equipped)
- Quote all Zote Precepts (this can be obtained for free. Why? Because fuck Zote)
- Get All Grubs (unused if you choose to replace grubs with mimicks)
- Get half of the grubs (unused if you choose to replace at least 23 grubs with mimicks)
- Get killed by your own shade (unused if you play on steel soul)
- Let a enemy drown in water (acid might also work, but that is untested)
- Unlock all stags
- Get all spells and talk with the vs Snail Shaman through all his dialogue (unused if you removed spell upgrades or replace junk with 1 geo)
- Kill all ghosts besides Cloth.
- "Spend" 10000 geo. Losing geo does also count.
- Equip Longnail and Mark of Pride at the same time.
- Bow while in a room with a nail master (except Sly)
- Get scammed by Millibelle.
- Kill Menderbug (currently unused)
- Give the flower to two npc which have dialogue for it. (Although there might be more. The only onces counting are: Elderbug, Emilitia, White Lady, Oro, Godseeker)
- Cast dive in Dirtmouth to sky dive into the well from at least the height of the king's pass entrance.

(Yeah I know, those aren't even 28, but if someone want, they can expand on that.)

### Cursed Reading
Randomizes the ability to read lore tablets includes the colo entry tablets as well as all "Point of Interest" locations and Menderbugs Diary.
The mod tries to display a message that the player can't read when they try. If that fails the interaction is removed entirely.

If you use "Randomize Shrine of Believers", the locations are only in logic if you have read even though you can obtain the items regardless if you have it or not.

### Cursed Listening
Randomizes the ability to talk to npc and therefore travelling with the stag and entering shops.
The mod tries to display a message that the player can't listen when they try. If that fails the interaction is removed entirely.
**If you kill a ghost npc before obtaining their check, the shiny will only spawn if you have this ability!**

**Currently it is possible to talk to Iselda once, because of unknown reason**
